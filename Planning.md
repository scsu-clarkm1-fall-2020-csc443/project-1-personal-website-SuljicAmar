# 1. Overiew - 

The purpose of my website is for it to act as a more in-depth resume. Often, it is hard to illustrate your true technical abilities on paper. Specifically, I am hoping to get a job out of college working in the big data field. 

This field is extremely competitive so this website will hopefully give me a chance to standout amongst other canidates. 

The site will be static and built using various bootstrap components. The site will consist of multiple pages such as, Home, About Me, Education, Work Experience, Contact Me. 

# 2. Goals - 
## Increase chance of getting hired
* Generate responses to Contact Me form
* Increase the amount of interviews I recieve.

## Make employers interested
* Showcase strong technical abilities


# Target Users - 
### Terry from HR ![](./img/1.jpg)

Terry's goal is to see if I meet the general criteria needed for employment by his company. Terry is not going to be digging through my code and evaluating my technical ability. Instead, Terry just wants to know if I have an undergraduate degree, the relevance of the degree, whether or not I have prior experience, and lastly whether or not I have some nice technical jargon in there. 

### Abe the Engineer ![](./img/2.jpg)
Abe will actually be evaluating my technical knowledge. Abe is concerned with what languages I can write but more importantly how effectively I can write these languages, whether or not I have completed any interesting projects, and lastly whether I have demonstrated effective problem solving abilities. 

### Hannah the statitscian ![](./img/3.jpg)
Hannah is not really concerned with my code per se, but she will be interested in my experience with predictive models. Another thing Hannah is looking for is whether or not I can display results effectively. I will need to include graphs and analysis of those graphs for my previous projects if I decide to throw them on the site. Lastly, the layout of my site will probably be most important to Hannah. I think she will sub consciously care whether or not my site is organized and displayed neatly. 

# Content - 
* Home - The homepage will just be used as an introduction to my site. I will probably just have a banner with a friendly theme and my name. I usually do not like having all your pages on one page but I really like claudiatenhoopes site (linked in similiar sites) so I may do something like that or I may just make seperate pages I am not sure yet. 

* About me - Here I will talk about my self on a more personal level but not too much. Just maybe talk about some outside hobbys if that. I will use the about me page as a place to vocalize my passions and desired field post graduation aka data science (although data science is pretty cliche now so I may just use the big data field)

* Education - Aside from stating the obvious facts about my education I think this would be an awesome place to talk about the classes I have taken and what I have learned in those classes. Often time I find that relevant courses on a paper resume mean nothing because you can't actually explain why those courses are relevant since you are bound to that one page rule. 

* Work Experience - Similiar to education. Aside from stating the obvious I can go more in depth with my previous employment. I have some decent experience with the highlight being an internship with a fortune 500 company. I can really expand on what I learned there and how that experience has prepared me for my future.

* Contact Me- Simple contact me form. Nothing crazy here. I have no social media at all. I know that that may be viewed as "weird" in todays society but I don't care. I wouldn't want to work for someone who cared about that sort of thing anyway. Therefore, the contact me page will be nothing more than a form with no links to any external sites.

David has a very clean structured design that I like. I also like how he uses a playful banner background.

Dons design is also extremely clean. Dons design is a little more sophisticated but still he uses a personal banner. I like how Don displays his projects and links their github repos. It shows he actually knows how to code.

Claudias design is by far my favorite. It is extremely simple yet very beautiful for lack of a better word. The site is organized so neatly that it makes me think very highly of Claudia and I do not even know her.
